# TastyTV
## The Client Brief
Our company, ‚ÄúTastyTV‚Äù is launching online soon. We are a movie and tv show live-streaming service, every day with a 12-hour repeating stream. And, we can't wait to help people discover amazing movies and tv shows.

We need to publicize the company and its offerings. For that, we need a promotional website that displays information about the company, the stream programming for the next few days, and regular announcements.

We would also like a special feature, which allows people to get a random tasty movie or tv show recommendation from our collection. 
The website should also have links to our social media accounts on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

We're also open to any creative ideas you might have.

## Deliverables
A functional website without any backend built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet that delivers on the following scope of work derived from the client brief including the following pages
- Home page with Company info (static) and social links
- Announcement page or section showing company announcements
- Programming page or section with the programming for the next few days
- Random movie page or section allowing users to get a random movie suggestion.
- Registration page with a form to register to the website
To help you start, we provide you with [sample data](https://gist.github.com/vanakenm/41074c7d583cbe0f9e4430496e8085c9) with information about some movies that you can use in your project. You don‚Äôt have to use our data (or you can add/enrich it) but we want the page with the programming schedule to use data from an array (same for the random page, should pick randomly inside it).
- A CodeSandbox project containing all your project assets
- The project should include a README file containing explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions (if any), unsolved problems, documentation assets and any other useful information.
- A brief presentation of your work, its supporting documentation and code
